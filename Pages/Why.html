                        <p id="blockD">Concentration and Focus: When your mental health is suffering, it can be
                            difficult to
                            concentrate
                            in class, focus on studying, and retain information. Anxiety, stress, and depression can
                            significantly impair cognitive function.
                            <br><br>
                            Motivation and Engagement: Feeling overwhelmed, anxious, or down can drain your motivation
                            and
                            make it hard to engage with your studies, participate in class, or complete assignments.
                            <br><br>
                            Performance and Grades: Over time, untreated mental health challenges can lead to decreased
                            academic performance, lower grades, and even difficulties in completing your degree.

                        <p id="blockD">The Mind-Body Connection: Your mental and physical health are closely linked.
                            Chronic stress,
                            anxiety, and depression can contribute to physical health problems like headaches, stomach
                            issues, sleep disturbances, weakened immune system, and even cardiovascular issues.
                            <br><br>
                            Energy Levels: Mental health struggles can often lead to fatigue and low energy levels,
                            making it challenging to manage daily tasks and responsibilities.

                        communicate
                        effectively with friends, family, and peers. You might withdraw, become irritable, or find it
                        difficult to maintain healthy relationships.
                        <br><br>
                        Social Isolation: Untreated mental health issues can lead to feelings of loneliness and
                        isolation, further exacerbating difficulties.

                        life.
